  "readme": "# react-pure-render\n\nA function, a component and a mixin for React pure rendering.\n\nThis module provides *exactly* the same functionality as [PureRenderMixin](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html), but as a standalone module and in three different flavors.\n\n### Usage\n\n#### Function\n\nThis is my preferred method, but it requires ES7 [class property transform](https://gist.github.com/jeffmo/054df782c05639da2adb) to be enabled by putting `{ \"stage\": 0 }` in your [.babelrc](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/).\n\n```js\nimport shouldPureComponentUpdate from 'react-pure-render/function';\n\nexport default class Button {\n  shouldComponentUpdate = shouldPureComponentUpdate;\n\n  render() { }\n}\n```\n\n#### Component\n\nInheritance is not very cool but it doesn't hurt a lot if it's just for the sake of this single method. If you don't want to use stage 0 transforms, you can use a base class instead:\n\n```js\nimport PureComponent from 'react-pure-render/component';\n\nexport default class Button extends PureComponent {\n  render() { }\n}\n```\n\n#### Mixin\n\nIf you're working with `createClass`-style components, use the mixin. It's exactly the same as [`React.addons.PureRenderMixin`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html).\n\n```js\nvar React = require('react');\nvar PureMixin = require('react-pure-render/mixin');\n\nvar Button = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [PureMixin],\n\n  render: function () { }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = Button;\n```\n\n#### shallowEqual\n\nSometimes `shallowEqual` is all you need. It's bad to reach out into React internals, so this library exposes exactly the same `shallowEqual` you already know and love from React.\n\n```js\nimport shallowEqual from 'react-pure-render/shallowEqual';\nconsole.log(shallowEqual({ x: 42 }, { x: 42 });\n```\n\n### Known Issues\n\nIf a component in the middle of your rendering chain has pure rendering, but some nested component relies on a `context` change up the tree, **the nested component won't learn about `context` change and won't update**. This is a [known React issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2517) that exists because `context` is not a documented feature and is not finished. However some React libraries already rely on `context`, for example, [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router). My suggestion for now is to use pure components in apps relying on such libraries very carefully, and only use pure rendering for leaf-ish components that are known *not* to rely on any parent `context`.\n\n### Further Reading\n\n* [PureRenderMixin](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html)\n* [Advanced Performance](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/advanced-performance.html)\n\n### License\n\nMIT\n",
